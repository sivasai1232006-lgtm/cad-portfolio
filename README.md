CAD projects using Autodesk Inventor

This repository contains selected CAD projects created using
Autodesk Inventor. These projects focus on part modelling, assemblies,
and basic mechanical mechanisms.

## Skills
- Part modelling and assemblies (Autodesk Inventor)
- Constraint-based design
- Mechanical mechanisms and structures

## Projects

### Vice Bench Assembly
- Designed a vice bench assembly including screw mechanism and jaws
- Focus on component interaction and constrained assemblies

### Geneva Mechanism
- Designed and assembled a Geneva mechanism to study intermittent motion
- Focus on kinematic constraints and motion transfer

### Nut and Bolt Assembly
- Standard fastener modelling and assembly
- Understanding of mechanical fastening and fits

### Basic Airplane Model
- Conceptual airplane CAD model
- Focus on structural layout and component placement

Note: Some assemblies are conceptual and created for learning purposes.
